In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
